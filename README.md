# mini-http-server
The current program is capable of handling only GET requests, returning the requested resource with minimal HTTP header fields back to the client. 

It can easily be scaled to handle POST/PUT/DELETE requests using the abstractions built into the program.

*Note: This project is purely for my own learning, it is most likely not the best way to set-up a HTTP server and/or handle/parse HTTP requests*
