# mini-http-server
This server is made to handle only GET requests, returning the requested resource with minimal HTTP header fields back to the client. However, I built it in a way that can be easily be scaled to handle POST/PUT/DELETE requests.

*Note: This project is purely for my own learning, it is most likely not the best way to set-up a HTTP server and handle/parse HTTP requests*
